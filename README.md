# Wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

# Key Elements found in a wireframe
- Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

# Types of Wireframes
## Low-Fidelity Wireframes
What they are:
- Simple sketches or basic digital layouts
- Focuses on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.

Purpose:
- Explore ideas quickly.
- Communicate basic user flow and content hierarchy.
- Encourage feedback before too much effort is invested.

When Used:
- Early in the design process (ideation and concept validation).
- During brainstorming sessions with stakeholders, designers, or developers.
- When comparing multiple layout options.

## High-Fidelity Wireframes
What they are:
- Detailed, polished, and realistic representations of the product.
- Often look very close to the final product (sometimes clickable).
- Include typography, colors, icons, images, branding, and sometimes interactions.

Purpose:
- Show stakeholders exactly how the product will look and feel.
- Test usability and user experience with real users.
- Provide developers with detailed guidance for implementation.

When Used:
- Later in the design process (after initial layouts are validated).
- For usability testing and user feedback.
- To hand off to developers before coding begins.

## Type of Wireframe used in the airbnb clone
It's a high-fidelity wireframe.
You can tell because it includes the typogrophy, colors, icons, images, etc.. and it looks exactly like what you'd want the end product to look like.
