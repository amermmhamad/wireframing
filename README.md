# Wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

# Key Elements found in a wireframe
- Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

# Types of Wireframes
## Low-Fidelity Wireframes
What they are:
- Simple sketches or basic digital layouts
- Focuses on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.

Purpose:
- Explore ideas quickly.
- Communicate basic user flow and content hierarchy.
- Encourage feedback before too much effort is invested.

When Used:
- Early in the design process (ideation and concept validation).
- During brainstorming sessions with stakeholders, designers, or developers.
- When comparing multiple layout options.

## High-Fidelity Wireframes
What they are:
- Detailed, polished, and realistic representations of the product.
- Often look very close to the final product (sometimes clickable).
- Include typography, colors, icons, images, branding, and sometimes interactions.

Purpose:
- Show stakeholders exactly how the product will look and feel.
- Test usability and user experience with real users.
- Provide developers with detailed guidance for implementation.

When Used:
- Later in the design process (after initial layouts are validated).
- For usability testing and user feedback.
- To hand off to developers before coding begins.

## Type of Wireframe used in the airbnb clone
It's a high-fidelity wireframe.
You can tell because it includes the typogrophy, colors, icons, images, etc.. and it looks exactly like what you'd want the end product to look like.

# Popular wireframing tools
- Figma
- Sketch
- Adobe XD
- InVision

## Figma
Figma is one of the best all-in-one tools for wireframing and prototyping, especially for learners and teams aiming for professional standards.<br>
Some of reasons why it's considered the industry standard:
- Lets you start low-fidelity (simple boxes, layouts) and gradually refine to high-fidelity designs without switching tools.
- Makes it easy to share work with teammates, mentors, or recruiters via a simple link.
- Has a huge community of free templates and UI kits to speed up your process.
- Because it’s widely used in the industry, learning Figma builds relevant job skills for web development and design roles.

# Benefits of wireframing from a software development perspective
- Wireframes reduce misunderstandings
- Helps developers see exactly what is required, instead of guessing from a vague text source.
- It's cheaper to adjust a wireframe, rather than re-write code after development.
- Acts as a shared language between the different teams working on one project. (UI/UX Designer, Web Developer, Product Owner, etc..)
- Developers can anticipate what kind of APIs or databases they would need depending on the wireframe given to them beforehand.

# Wireframing in Practice
This boils down to a four step scenario.
- The situation
- Usability issue discovered.
- How this issue was resolved.
- It's impact on the Final Product.

## The Situtation
A product team was designing a new checkout feature for an e-commerce platform. Before writing a single line of code, they created wireframes to visualize the user flow from “Add to Cart” to “Payment Confirmation.”

## Usability issue discovered
The initial wireframe required users to click through five different screens to complete checkout (shipping info, billing info, account creation, review order, payment). Testers immediately flagged this as too long and frustrating.

## How this issue was resolved
Combined shipping and billing into a single screen and allowed order review + payment on one page thus, reducing steps from 5 to 3.

## Impact on Final Product
Higher converstion rate as there was reduced cart abandonment, and improved user satisfaction as users reported the checkout as "faster and easier."
